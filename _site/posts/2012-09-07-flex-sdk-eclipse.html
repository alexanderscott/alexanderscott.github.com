<h2>Compiling the Flex 4.5 SDK in Eclipse for the brave & patient</h2>
<p>Unwilling to shell out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-Flash-Builder-4-5-Premium/dp/B004VAOJJ8/ref=pd_cp_sw_0">~$600</a> 
for Flash Builder 4 Premium or upgrade from my older Flex 3 IDE, my Actionscript development halted a couple of years ago. 
Not wanting to give up completely on Adobe webdev, I gave the open-source Flex SDK a shot and configured my Eclipse environment for good-old Flash. 
The result wasn't as painless as I'd thought.</p>

<p>First download the Flash uninstaller (<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html">Mac</a>, <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html">Windows</a>) and . Might want to bookmark or save this blog URL since the Flash loader will make you force-quit all internet browsers.</p>

<p>After giving Flash the boot, grab the latest Flex SDK from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html">Adobe's developer site</a>. The SDK includes the compiler we need in our build setup - <i>sdk<em>root/bin/mxmlc</i> - 
so extract the SDK somewhere you'll remember. It also includes an installer for the latest debug version of Flash inside <i>sdk</em>root/runtimes/player/xx.x/your_os</i>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Setting up a Flex SDK project in Eclipse involves creating a builder and passing in custom arguments. The builder simply compiles the application using lib &amp; SDK references and saves it to a SWF file in the bin folder. The arguments look like
<i>src/application.mxml -output=bin/application.swf -library-path+=libs/ -target-player=xx.x</i>
with the 'xx.x' replaced by the minimum version of Flash required by the SDK you are using. Min versions by SDK are:</p>

<p>Flex 4.0 SDK - Flash 10.0 minimum
Flex 4.5 SDK - Flash 10.2 minimum
Flex 4.6 SDK - Flash 11.1 minimum</p>

<p>I won't go through the Eclipse project setup here as other blogs cover this pretty in-depth. See these for coverage:

<p>Scouring Google will lead to some pitfalls searching for up-to-date MXML &amp; AS3 editor plugins for your non-Flash-Builder IDE. To save you the trouble, FlexFormatter is the best plugin I've found and lets you customize the format handling of both MXML &amp; AS3.</p>

<p>Other widely used, open-source plugins are xsd4mxml and Axdt. I'm not sure though if these plugin projects are still being maintained.</p>

<p>While you're at it you'll want to gitclone and import <a href="https://github.com/mikechambers/as3corelib" target="_blank">as3corelib</a> - a practical swiss-army knife of actionscript classes and utilities.</p>

<p>On the subject, if you're up for trying a new actionscript development architecture I've been very impressed by <a href="http://swizframework.org/" target="_blank">Swiz Framework</a>. Swiz uses Inversion of Control through instantiating a BeanProvider class which initially registers controllers, delegates, services, models, and presentation-models (declared as prototypes). These can be flexibly injected with bindings throughout the app. It even supports reverse and two-way (bijection?) bindings.</p>
