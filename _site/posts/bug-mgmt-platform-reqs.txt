MUST HAVE
* Ability to merge bugs or bind them as related
* Separate but integrated with Trello (or whatever sprint task mgmt/estimation tool)
* Can upload screenshots easily and attach files
* Can tag/label bugs and assign, prioritizeable
* Logs and bug archive with timestamps, filterable, shows who closed and when
* Opt in notifications per status (ex/ I am notified when new or pushed back) 
* Can comment on specific activity items  (not just one long stream of comments not tied to anything)
* Analytics (how fast are they piling up?  how fast are they being closed?  how has this changed over sprint cycles?)

REALLY LIKE TO HAVE
* Can tie source code or specific commit to a bug that it fixes
* Ability to write in markdown format (have you ever tried copy/pasting code into trello? don't.)
* Can close or change bug status from command line (ideally from a specific pull request)
* Notification system ideally through growl, an app, browser extension, or something which isn't email
