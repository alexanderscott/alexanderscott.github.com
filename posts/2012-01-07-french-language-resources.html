So one of your New Year's resolutions was to pick up a foreign language.  
Whether it be for a planned vacation, connection with a relative, career opportunity, picking up girls, etc. learning a new language can be daunting but rewarding.  
And best yet, free.

<em>My situation:</em> given roughly 2 months notice for a new project manager role based out of a manufacturing town in eastern France.  One of those months would be spent traveling and studying in China.  Four years of Spanish taken in high school but squat French.

<em>The goal:</em> to become as adept at listening and comprehension as possible using after-work-hours in that short window.  Pressure and deadlines are excellent motivators - and in a short time I would need to co-exist in a small town with sparse English fluency.  Below are some resources I found essential.

<em>The result:  </em>Basic comprehension and speaking in only 2 months.  
These skills increased greatly after relocating to France and befriending some helpful locals.  Maintenant j'aime parler français!
